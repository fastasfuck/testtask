# DevOps interview

Our interview process is composed of two rounds.

The first one is a generic discussion with Dominic, our CTO.
The second is a technical assessment which this repository is related to.

You should gain access to this codebase 48 hours prior the technical assessment round.

## What's inside this repository?

This repository contains 3 Terraform projects:
  - 2 of them are challenges to solve by yourself
    - [network](./implement/network/README.md)
    - [secrets](./implement/secrets/README.md)
  - and 1 is to review together
    - [review](./review/README.md)

The two challenges should take 30 minutes to solve each if you're already familiar with AWS, Terraform, Helm and Kubernetes.
If you lack experience with one of them, solving the challenges should still be within 4 hours in total.

Please read the individual READMEs and try to solve both challenges on your own time and send back your solution at least 1 hour before the technical assessment.

We're not looking for "the perfect" solution, but you'll be asked about decisions you make.

## Technical assessment round

The second round of the interview process is planned to be one hour long.

In the first 20 minutes you're expected to review our project (review directory) pointing out at least 5 problems and to add recommendations fixing them.
The project includes 10+ problems.

The remaining 40 minutes are going to be split between the two solutions you send back to us to the "network" and "secrets" challenges. Approximately 20-20 minutes.

In this part we're going to code review your solutions to each challenges.
Please be prepared to explain what was your approach to each problems and why.
